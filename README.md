# Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory-Analysis
## üìù Overview
This project was focused on analyzing past sales data from Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), a company that sells office supplies and furniture across different customer types ‚Äî individual, small businesses, and corporate clients. I was asked to look into the Abuja division using the order records from 2009 to 2012. My task was to go through the Excel file, run some SQL queries, and bring out useful insights that can help the business improve sales and manage costs better.
## üéØ OBJECTIVES
* Which product category brought in the most sales
* The top 3 and bottom 3 regions in terms of sales
* Total appliance sales in Ontario
* Suggestions on how to increase revenue from low-performing customers
* Which shipping method cost the most
* Who the most valuable customers are and what they usually buy
* Small business customer with the highest sales
* Corporate customer that placed the most orders
* Consumer customer with the highest profit
* Customers who returned items and the segment they belong to
* Whether shipping choices made sense compared to order priority
  ## üßπ DATA PREPARATION
* Cleaned up the Excel file and made sure all the columns were readable
* Used SQL to run the main queries (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT, ORDER BY)
* Used Excel for quick checks, visualizations, and totals
* Filtered, grouped, and sorted the data to make it easier to find answers
  ## üîç My Findings
### Case Scenario I
1. *Top Category by Sales*
  * One category clearly outperformed others based on total sales.
2. *Top 3 and Bottom 3 Regions*## üßπ What I Did First
 * Cleaned up the Excel file and made sure all the columns were readable
 * Used SQL to run the main queries (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT, ORDER BY)
 * Used Excel for quick checks, visualizations, and totals
 * Filtered, grouped, and sorted the data to make it easier to find answers
 * I listed all regions by total sales and picked the highest and lowest three.
3. *Appliances in Ontario*
 * Found and added up only the appliance sales in Ontario ‚Äî this was straightforward.
4. *Bottom 10 Customers ‚Äì Suggestions*
 * Some customers barely ordered anything. I suggested things like discounts, bundle offers, or follow-ups to boost their interest.
5. *Highest Shipping Cost*
 * One shipping method was responsible for most of the total shipping cost ‚Äî could be re-evaluated.
### Case Scenario II
6. *Most Valuable Customers*
 * Found based on total money spent. Also noted what they usually buy.
7. *Small Business with Highest Sales*
 * Picked out the customer in the small business segment with the highest purchase total.
8. *Corporate Client with Most Orders*
 * Checked order counts and found the corporate client that ordered the most from 2009‚Äì2012.
9. *Most Profitable Consumer*
 * Looked at profit column to find the top consumer.
10. *Returned Items*
 * Pulled all customers who returned something and checked their segment.
11. *Shipping vs. Order Priority*
 * Compared shipping methods with the urgency level of the order.
 * Delivery Truck is cheap but slow
  * Express Air is fast but expensive
  * Found a few cases where the expensive option was used for a low-priority order ‚Äî might be wasting money there.

## üìä Tools I Used
* *SQL* ‚Äì For querying and finding totals, groupings, and rankings
* *Excel* ‚Äì For visuals (charts and tables) and filtering data
* *Charts Used*:
 * Bar charts for region performance
 * Tables for customer insights
 * Slicers for easier filtering
   ## ‚úÖ My Suggestions
* Promote products in the top-selling category
* Improve sales in weaker regions with better offers
* Talk to low-paying customers and offer deals to get them to order more
* Watch shipping costs ‚Äî use faster methods only when necessary
* Track return patterns and maybe improve product handling or quality
* Keep strong customers happy with better support or loyalty perks
  ## üìÅ Files I Worked On
* *KMS\_InventoryAnalysis.xlsx* ‚Äì for final outputs and visualizations
* *SQL\_Queries\_KMS.sql* ‚Äì all the queries I used for analysis
